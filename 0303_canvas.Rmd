1. Navigate to your assignment and click the "Submit Assignment" button.
2. Double-check your work to ensure it's complete and saved correctly.
3. Upload or type your work and click "Submit Assignment."

After you submit your assignment, you will see confetti on your screen, indicating successful submission.

## Viewing Feedback and Grades

To view feedback on submitted assignments:

1. Log into the course and click on the 'Grades' link.
2. Find the assignment and click the assignment name.
3. Click on 'View Feedback' to view all feedback, including comments and any additional annotated comments made on the submission.

To accurately calculate your grades in Canvas:

1. Uncheck the "Calculate based only on graded assignments" checkbox when viewing your grades.
2. Familiarize yourself with [grade icons and colors](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-16533-4212829283).

## Canvas Features and Troubleshooting

### Calendar

The Calendar feature in Canvas allows you to see assignments and important dates for all your classes. Click the calendar icon to access your calendar, where you can view specific class work or color code your schedule.

### Locked Assignments

If an assignment, activity, or quiz is locked, it means some requirements for unlocking the activity have not been met. Check the listed requirements and complete them to unlock the activity.

```{r echo = FALSE,out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("img/requirements.png")
```
