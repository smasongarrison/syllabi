Welcome to all my syllabi! This website is designed to accompany all of Mason Garrison's courses at Wake Forest University. Over the semesters, I have found that my syllabi keep growing longer and longer as my career has progressed. 
I know that no one likes reading 8 page syllabi. However, I want to make sure that all my students know what my expectations are. So in that spirit, I've created a website to contain all of my policies in one place. 
That way, I can have a neat and tidy syllabi, while still making my expectations clear.
