# FAQ

## I've spotted a mistake or would like to contribute

Please [open a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Better yet, please fork the repo and [submit an upstream pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Your contributions are greatly appreciated, but please be aware that I may be slow to respond while this course is still in development. Similarly, I am unlikely to help with software troubleshooting or conceptual difficulties for non-enrolled students. Other members of the community may be able to help. If you would like to contribute but don't have a specific idea in mind, you can check out the issues section for potential suggestions.
