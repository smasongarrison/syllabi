# Course Description

Data Science for Psychologists (DSP) introduces on the principles of data science, including data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and communication. In this class, we link those principles to psychological methods and open science practices by emphasizing exploratory analyses and description, rather than confirmatory analyses and prediction. We'll work our way thru Wickham and Grolemund's R for Data Science text (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and develop expertise in tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/). This class emphasizes replication and reproducibility. DSP is a practical skilled-based class and should be useful to students aiming for academia as well as those interested in industry. Applications of these methods can be applied to a full range of psychological areas, including perception (e.g, eye-tracking data), neuroscience (e.g., visualizing neural networks), and individual differences (e.g., valence analysis).


## Broad goals for the course:
- 1. Reproducibility;
- 2. Replication;
- 3. Robust Methods;
- 4. Really Nice Visualization; and
- 5. R.

# Required Materials

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", include=FALSE} 
bib[sort(c("funder_personality_2016"))]
``` 

Wickham and Grolemund's R for Data Science text (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)



### How to use the required text:

The text is intended to supplement the lectures. The lectures don't follow the order of chapters in the text and the text covers some material that won't be covered in the lectures, i.e., not all the information in each chapter is perfectly pertinent to the course requirements.


# Course Assignments

<!---
You will be formally evaluated in five different ways.



## Individual data Project

You will turn in your individual data collection/data analysis projects on Wednesday, September 18.  These projects are described in a separate handout. This project will be worth 10% of your grade.

## Quiz
There will be two 30-minute quizzes over lecture material and readings (on September 25 and October 30).  These will be objective style quizzes.  Make-ups will only be given under extraordinary circumstances and by prior arrangement. Each quiz = 10% of your grade.


## Presentations
You will give two asynchronous presentations.  Your team will give a 15-20 minute presentation of its data analysis problem.  In addition, you will give a 15- minute individual presentation.  These presentations are chance to practice a formal presentation in a relatively pressure-free setting).

## Presentation
You will give one asynchronous presentation. approximately 10- minutes.  This presentation is chance to practice a formal presentation in a relatively pressure-free setting).


## Lab

<stuff about these should be in here>

## Portfolio
The major semester projects (described on the separate hand-out) is a set of EDA Projects, which you will summarize in an EDA Portfolio to be handed in on the last day of class.


<!---
### Quiz Dates

- Quiz 1: Friday, `r advdate(dayone, 5, assignment="f")`

- Quiz 2: Friday, `r advdate(dayone, 10, assignment="f")`

-->

## Engagement

This experiential course requires active engagement. There will be few lectures and we will not be building toward an exam.  Instead, we will work together to build our facilities for thinking critically about data. You should come to every class having read all of the required reading, watched the required videos, browsed the suggested resources, and so forth. You should enter the classroom prepared to discuss these materials with colleagues and complete both individual and group in-class assignments.

<!---

### Activities

Because this class is blended, there will be multiple online engagement activities. These activities will allow you engage with the material for each module. Details about the specific activities will be provided on canvas.
