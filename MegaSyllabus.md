# (PART\*) Policies {-}


# Policy Overview

In this section, I provide specific language for all of my course policies. These policies are in addition to the policies and procedures outlined in the university [bulletin](https://bulletin.wfu.edu). There are slight differences between the [undergraduate college](https://bulletin.wfu.edu/undergraduate/) and the [graduate school](https://bulletin.wfu.edu/graduate/). 



## Changes

This syllabus is intended to provide the student with guidance on what may be covered during the semester and will be followed as closely as possible. The dates for tests and assignments will not change except for extraordinary events. I reserve the right to modify, supplement, and make changes as the course needs arise. I try to avoid making changes to the syllabus. However, if substantive changes occur, I will only make changes that are less burdensome and more advantageous to the students. (If I make a change that increases your burden, please talk to me so that we can find a solution.)

### Interpretation

If any policies in this syllabus require interpretation, the instructor's determination is final. That determination will be consistent with the original intent of the policy. Clarifications and interpretations will be committed to the syllabus github repo to codify the document's intent.

# 255: Personality {-#personality}





## Course Description   {-}

This class provides a survey of theory and research on the structure and function of human personality, with attention to the relationship to cognition, emotion, motivation, and behavior. It requires P-PSY 151. In addition, we will discuss other individual differences, such as intelligence.

### Broad goals for the course:   {-}
- 1. The first is for you to understand what personality psychologists think. We will cover classic and current theories, research, and applications of Personality psychology.
- 2. The second is for you to learn how personality psychologists study their field scientifically. We will discuss the procedures used to test theories and to study issues related to personality.
- 3. The third is to (hopefully) recognize some relevance of personality psychology for your personal and/or professional life.


## Required Materials   {-}

[1] D. C. Funder. _The personality puzzle_. Seventh. OCLC: 935283402.
New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 2016. ISBN: 978-0-393-60042-1.


## Course Assignments   {-}

### Quizzes   {-}

There will be 15 multiple-choice reading quizzes (effectively these are weekly). The best 12 out of 15 quiz grades will be used to determine your total quiz grade.  You can drop 3 of the quizzes for any reason.

### Exams   {-}

There will be 3 exams. The best 2 out of 3 exam grades will be used to determine your total exam grade.  You can drop 1 of the exams for any reason.


#### Exams Dates   {-}

- Exam 1: Friday, 09/23

- Exam 2: Friday, 11/11

- Exam 3: During Finals, 12/16


### Short Assignments   {-}

There will be three (3) short assignments in this course. These assignments will allow you to incorporate some of your own interests into the course. Such interests could be related to your career, another class you're taking, a hobby you're exploring, or some other random fancy. They will typically be approximately two (2) pages. I will provide more specific written guidelines at least two weeks before each assignment is due.


The best two (2) out of three (3) short assignments will be used to determine your total short assignments.  You can skip one of the assignments for any reason.


#### Short Assignment Dates   {-}

- Assignment 1: Friday, 10/14: Critique of an online personality test.

- Assignment 2: Friday, 12/09: Critique of a personality-related media article.

- Assignment 3: Friday, NA: Critique of a personality-related YouTube video.



### Engagement Activities   {-}

There will be multiple engagement activities in this course. These activities will allow you engage with the material for each module. Details about the specific activities will be provided on canvas. Students must complete two activities per module. For students in the blended section, they can attend their weekly in-person session and count it as an engagement activity.


## Grading Policy   {-}



Typically, an A- is defined as 90% of the highest point total in the class, B- as 80% of that total, C- as 70 and D- as 60%.
I may shift these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point distribution.
By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher grades than if no re-scaling were done.
This curve can only help your grade.

The full table is provided below:

Table: (\#tab:unnamed-chunk-4)Full Table

|Letter | Cutoff|
|:------|------:|
|A      |   0.95|
|A-     |   0.90|
|B+     |   0.87|
|B      |   0.83|
|B-     |   0.80|
|C+     |   0.77|
|C      |   0.73|
|C-     |   0.70|
|D+     |   0.67|
|D      |   0.63|
|D-     |   0.60|

### Curve Projections    {-}

Unsurprisingly, students have many questions about the curve in this class. For tests and other assignments, I try to provide a projected letter grade.
This projected letter grade is there to give you a sense of what your score *would* be if I implemented the class curve on this particular assignment.
It is a projection. It is not a guarantee. These projected letter grades are not incorporated into your final grade.
Trust me, you do not want me to curve by assignment.



### Weighting   {-}

- 200 points of your grade will be determined by your best two (2) exams.
- 100 points of your grade will be determined by your best two short assignments.
- 30 points of your grade will be determined by your engagement.
- 120 points of your grade will be determined by your best 12 quizzes
