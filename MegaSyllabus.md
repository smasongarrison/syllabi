# (PART\*) Policies {-}


# Policy Overview

In this section, I provide specific language for all of my course policies. These policies are in addition to the policies and procedures outlined in the university [bulletin](https://bulletin.wfu.edu). There are slight differences between the [undergraduate college](https://bulletin.wfu.edu/undergraduate/) and the [graduate school](https://bulletin.wfu.edu/graduate/). 



## Changes

This syllabus is intended to provide the student with guidance on what may be covered during the semester and will be followed as closely as possible. The dates for tests and assignments will not change except for extraordinary events. I reserve the right to modify, supplement, and make changes as the course needs arise. I try to avoid making changes to the syllabus. However, if substantive changes occur, I will only make changes that are less burdensome and more advantageous to the students. (If I make a change that increases your burden, please talk to me so that we can find a solution.)

### Interpretation

If any policies in this syllabus require interpretation, the instructor's determination is final. That determination will be consistent with the original intent of the policy. Clarifications and interpretations will be committed to the syllabus github repo to codify the document's intent.

# Accommodations Policy

If you are (or become) disabled (in any capacity, permanently, or temporarily), and need accommodations in class, reading, or any other work in this course, please contact me to discuss your specific needs as soon as possible. 
Under my favorite civil rights legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act as amended you are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations for disabilities. These laws include the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990](https://beta.ada.gov/) and [ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADA_Amendments_Act_of_2008). 
I will do everything in my capacity as your professor to ensure that you receive those accommodations. 

Students who need reasonable accommodations for disabilities also should contact the Center for Learning, Access, and Student Success  (118 Reynolda Hall, 336-758-5929,  [class.wfu.edu](https://class.wfu.edu/)). You can request accommodations through the [student portal (olympic.accessiblelearning.com/WFU/)](https://olympic.accessiblelearning.com/WFU/) These accommodations are not retroactive. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to use those accommodations. 

Do not feel guilty about using them. 
You rightfully deserve them, in the legal, moral, and ethical sense. 
These accommodations are there so that you can be your best possible self. 




## Self-Advocacy

At Wake Forest and at many other places, the expectation is that you will self-advocate for yourselves and know exactly what you need. Is that a good expectation? Is that a good model? Is that equitable? I have thoughts... regardless, that is the current state of the world. Accordingly, you will have to advocate for what you need. If this process seems daunting, please talk to me! Regardless, I am happy to talk with you about this process and to share my own experiences.



```{=html}
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every time we write that self-advocacy is key to disabled students&#39; success, we need to include an asterisk and note, &quot;BUT IT SHOULDN&#39;T BE&quot; <br><br>Disabled students deserve success regardless of how well they can navigate the system and cajole/plead/argue with profs for access.</p>&mdash; The ADHD Academic (@theADHDacademic) <a href="https://twitter.com/theADHDacademic/status/1458876178580881410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2021</a></blockquote>

```

As a student, you may not know what accommodations work best for you. Or you may find that your current accommodations don't work like they used to. 

As you journey thru your career, you may find that you need different kinds of accommodations. Or at least that has been my experience... There are numerous resources for ideas. 
My personal favorite is [JAN](https://askjan.org/). Technically, JAN (Job Accommodation Network) is focused on employment and jobs. 
However, I still have found this to be a wonderful resource for ideas. 
You can [search for accommodation ideas](https://askjan.org/soar.cfm) by [specific](https://askjan.org/a-to-z.cfm):

  - disability,
  - limitation,
  - task,
  - topic, or
  - accommodation.

# Classroom Climate

I aim to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including but not limited to race, ethnicity, sex, gender, gender-identity, class, sexual orientation, religion, disability, political affiliation). To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!

- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I can direct you to resources

- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. 

- If you reached here in the syllabus, e-mail me a picture of a cat. If you do it before the end of the first week, you get a small bonus. (And even if its after the first week, feel free to still send me a cat picture.)

## Statements

### From the psychology department
The Psychology Department values, respects, and celebrates the experiences, beliefs, and practices stemming from varied cultures and circumstances (emphasizing, but not limited to, those from historically underrepresented groups),and our deep commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion plays out through coursework, programming by majors, and research. 

### How I'd expand it
The Psychology Department values, respects, and celebrates the experiences, beliefs, and practices stemming from varied cultures and circumstances ( emphasizing, but not limited to, those from marginalized groups, including those historically underrepresented). We center our department around our deep commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and access. That deep commitment plays out through coursework, programming by majors, service, outreach, and research.
