## How to use this syllabus {-}


This syllabus website is dynamic. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes. Unless otherwise indicidated, all the policies apply to all of my courses.

This syllabus is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, you'll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page. The syllabus will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester; however, students aren't bound to policies added once they've signed their syllabus. Instead, they are bound to the version of this "book" that was in place when they signed their syllabus. <!--I have archived versions of this book [here](https://github.com/smasongarrison/syllabi/blob/main/docs/megasyllabus.pdf). -->

# Colophon {-}

This syllabus was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The [website][web] is hosted with [github](https://www.github.com), The complete source is available from [github][git].

The book style adapted from [Desir√©e De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/).

This version of the syllabus was built with:


```{r message = FALSE,error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(path = "DESCRIPTION") %>% 
  pull(Package) 

session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)

session$platform
```

Along with these packages:


```{r message = FALSE,error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
  }else{
    
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = 
                               nrow(session$packages), 
                               autoWidth = TRUE,
                               bInfo = FALSE,
                               paging = FALSE))
}

```

The R session information when compiling this book is shown below:

```{r include=FALSE}
# only show versions of very relevant packages
sessionInfo = function() {
  lapply(c('shiny', 'miniUI'), loadNamespace)
  res = utils::sessionInfo()
  loaded = res$loadedOnly
  res$loadedOnly = loaded[intersect(names(loaded), c(
    'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'shiny', 'htmltools', 'tools', 'miniUI'
  ))]
  res$BLAS = res$LAPACK = NULL
  res
}
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r links, child="links.md"}
```
