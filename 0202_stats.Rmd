## Course Description

Methods in Psychological Research introduces statistics and research design for students minoring in psychology. Prereq: Pâ€”PSY 151 (D, QR)

This course is designed to help students develop the conceptual background and practical skills necessary to evaluate the statistics encountered in their coursework and in everyday life. It emphasizes selection, application, and interpretation. Topics to be covered include statistical inference, probability distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing, and correlation. The goal will be to go beyond rote memorization of abstract formulas and for students to develop an appreciation for the critical role that statistics plays in psychological science.

Selected Course Objectives:


### Broad goals for the course:
- 1. To understand the selection, computation, and interpretation of descriptive and inferential
statistics
- 2. To learn how to use and interpret R (R Core Team 2018).
