## Course Description  {-}

Methods in Psychological Research introduces statistics and research design for students minoring in psychology. Prereq: Pâ€”PSY 151 (D, QR)

This course is designed to help students develop the conceptual background and practical skills necessary to evaluate the statistics encountered in their coursework and in everyday life. It emphasizes selection, application, and interpretation. Topics to be covered include statistical inference, probability distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing, and correlation. The goal will be to go beyond rote memorization of abstract formulas and for students to develop an appreciation for the critical role that statistics plays in psychological science.


## Required Materials  {-}

Morling, Research Methods in Psychology https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393893724


## Course Assignments  {-}
### Grading Policy   {-}

```{r child = './common/content/grading.Xmd'}
```

### Quizzes   {-}

There will be 14 multiple-choice reading quizzes (effectively these are weekly). The best 10 out of 14 quiz grades will be used to determine your total quiz grade.  You can drop 4 of the quizzes for any reason.

### Exams   {-}

There will be 3 exams. The best 2 out of 3 exam grades will be used to determine your total exam grade.  You can drop 1 of the exams for any reason.


#### Exams Dates   {-}

- Exam 1: Friday, `r advdate(dayone, exams[1], assignment="f")`

- Exam 2: Friday, `r advdate(dayone, exams[2], assignment="f")`

- Exam 3: During Finals, `r advdate(dayone, exams[3], assignment="f")`


### Short Assignments   {-}

There will be two (2) short assignments in this course. These assignments will allow you to incorporate some of your own interests into the course. Such interests could be related to your career, another class you're taking, a hobby you're exploring, or some other random fancy. They will typically be approximately two (2) pages. I will provide more specific written guidelines at least two weeks before each assignment is due.


The best one (1) out of two (2) short assignments will be used to determine your total short assignments.  You can skip one of the assignments for any reason.


#### Assignment Dates   {-}

- Assignment 1: Friday, `r advdate(dayone, assignments[1], assignment="f")`: Qualitative Critique 1

- Assignment 2: Friday, `r advdate(dayone, assignments[2], assignment="f")`: Qualitative Critique 2



## Engagement Activities   {-}

There will be multiple engagement activities in this course. These activities will allow you engage with the material for each module. Details about the specific activities will be provided on canvas. Students must complete two activities per module.


## Grading Weighting   {-}

- 200 points of your grade will be determined by your best two (2) exams.
- 50 points of your grade will be determined by your best assignment.
- 50 points of your grade will be determined by your engagement.
- 100 points of your grade will be determined by your best 10 quizzes.
