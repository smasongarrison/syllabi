# How to do well in my classes

To do well in the course, you should read the assigned material before class and re-read previously assigned material as the course progresses. 
By reading the text before class, you will be better prepared to ask questions and integrate the content of lectures with what was presented in the text. 
For synchronous classes, be sure to attend all lectures and arrive on time. 
For asynchronous classes be sure to watch all the video lectures and don't leave them until the last minute. Each topic builds directly on the previous one. 
Thus, if you miss one lecture or zip through a video, you run the risk of being completely lost in the next lecture.

## College Workload

[WFU on Credit Hours](https://registrar.wfu.edu/facultystaff-information/semester-credit-hour/)

Wake Forest uses something called a "semester credit hour" to measure the amount of coursework you will be doing. This number reflects the outcomes we expect you to achieve, the mode of instruction, scheduled in-class time, and the amount of outside preparatory work expected for the class.

At a general rule, you can expect to work an average of two hours outside of class for every hour spent in the classroom. So, for example, if you have a three-credit course that meets for three hours a week, you can expect to spend around six hours a week working on that course outside of class. This includes reading, homework, writing, research, and any other coursework required for the class.

If you are taking a standard 15-hour course load, you can expect to spend approximately 15 hours in the classroom and around 30 hours outside of the classroom for an average total of 45 hours of classroom work, study, writing, research, etc. each week. Over the course of a 15-week semester, this adds up to 135 hours of work per semester per course and 675 hours per semester for a full course load.

Remember, this is just an average. Some weeks you may have more work to do than others, and some classes may require more outside work than others. However, understanding the expected workload for each course can help you plan your time and stay on top of your coursework.

## Successful Asynchronous Learning

I've created a [video](https://youtu.be/dc3D2tbl8G0) highlighting how to be a successful asynchronous learner. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Important Information for College and This Course:

In addition, many professors have implicit (*i.e.*, unspoken) expectations for college classes. 
I'm going to explicitly state some of those unspoken expectations. I suspect that your other professors have similar expectations -- so this information will help you in your other classes.

College courses put the onus on **YOU** to keep up with the work. You are not guaranteed any reminders throughout the semester. Go to the schedule included here and put it in your calendar. You should also:

1. check course announcements on Canvas often, and 
2. check your email tied to Canvas often. 
  
Email and canvas is how I communicate with you, and I will not continually repeat myself in emails after I have already posted or sent the information.

High school and college are different. In high school, you may have been permitted to turn in work as late as you like, to redo assignments or quizzes until you were satisfied, and to complete extra credit work. This is not the case in this college-level course. Unless explicitly stated, there are no late assignments, make-up work, redoing of assignments, or extra credit. These are course policies; they are not opportunities for negotiation. Although I am always happy to explain the reasoning and calculus behind my policies, they are not negotiable. 

There is also a prevalent attitude of, "it doesn't hurt to ask." Yes, it does. If I have already made clear my policies and expectations, asking me to violate them damages your credibility as a student. One day you may ask for something that is truly reasonable given an emergency situation, but by then your reputation will precede you. Do not be "the student who cried wolf;" it is not a respected position.

Finally, you should understand that college is not a fee-for-service arrangement. You are not paying me. You are paying tuition to a University for all kinds of things, very little of which actually "pays my salary." Salaries are more commonly paid out of government funds, including grants. You start with a zero in college courses and earn your points from there. I am not "giving" you grades or "taking away" points. You have nothing to begin with and earn your own score based on what you do and how well you do it (not simply on effort). My role is to offer you an opportunity for education, not just a grade.

## Addition pieces of advice:

- Read the syllabus.
- Read all the class announcements.
- Read the FAQ and post your questions about the class there.
- Read and follow the instructions for each assignment. 
- Read your professor's comments on your submissions -- especially if you did not get full credit on that submission.
- Treat canvas messages like email.
- Read and respond to canvas messages from your professor. 
- Before you send email your professor, try to answer the question yourself by looking at the syllabus, reading the course FAQ, and reading the assignment instructions.
- Know when assignment deadlines are.
- If you need additional time or flexibility on an assignment, you communicate with your professor before the deadline passes.
