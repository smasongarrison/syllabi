The best 12 out of 15 quiz grades will be used to determine your total quiz grade. You can drop 3 of the quizzes for any reason. Exams There will be 3 exams. The best 2 out of 3 exam grades will be used to determine your total exam grade. You can drop 1 of the exams for any reason. Exams Dates Exam 1: Friday, 09/23 Exam 2: Friday, 11/11 Exam 3: During Finals, 12/16 Short Assignments There will be three (3) short assignments in this course. These assignments will allow you to incorporate some of your own interests into the course. Such interests could be related to your career, another class youre taking, a hobby youre exploring, or some other random fancy. They will typically be approximately two (2) pages. I will provide more specific written guidelines at least two weeks before each assignment is due. The best two (2) out of three (3) short assignments will be used to determine your total short assignments. You can skip one of the assignments for any reason. Short Assignment Dates Assignment 1: Friday, 10/14: Critique of an online personality test. Assignment 2: Friday, 12/09: Critique of a personality-related media article. Assignment 3: Friday, NA: Critique of a personality-related YouTube video. Engagement Activities There will be multiple engagement activities in this course. These activities will allow you engage with the material for each module. Details about the specific activities will be provided on canvas. Students must complete two activities per module. For students in the blended section, they can attend their weekly in-person session and count it as an engagement activity. Grading Policy Typically, an A- is defined as 90% of the highest point total in the class, B- as 80% of that total, C- as 70 and D- as 60%. I may shift these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point distribution. By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher grades than if no re-scaling were done. This curve can only help your grade. The full table is provided below: Table 6.1: Full Table Letter Cutoff A 0.95 A- 0.90 B+ 0.87 B 0.83 B- 0.80 C+ 0.77 C 0.73 C- 0.70 D+ 0.67 D 0.63 D- 0.60 Curve Projections Unsurprisingly, students have many questions about the curve in this class. For tests and other assignments, I try to provide a projected letter grade. This projected letter grade is there to give you a sense of what your score would be if I implemented the class curve on this particular assignment. It is a projection. It is not a guarantee. These projected letter grades are not incorporated into your final grade. Trust me, you do not want me to curve by assignment. Weighting 200 points of your grade will be determined by your best two (2) exams. 100 points of your grade will be determined by your best two short assignments. 30 points of your grade will be determined by your engagement. 120 points of your grade will be determined by your best 12 quizzes Schedule "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
