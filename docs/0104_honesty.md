# Academic Honesty Policy

In this course, you will be held to the standards of the Wake Forest Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you signed your application for admission to the institution. 
If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the [Honor System Handbook](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu/). 
That handbook outlines the Universityâ€™s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.

All submitted work must be your own. It is your responsibility to avoid even the appearance of cheating.

Unless I have explicitly stated otherwise, every assessment is closed to outside resources (including, but not limited to books, notes, phones, people, Chegg, the internet). 
Ignorance of the honor code and assignment instructions is not an acceptable explanation and/or defense. 


## Common Sense

To be clear, even if something is NOT explicitly forbidden in this document, that does not mean it is allowed. Please use your common sense here. If a reasonable person would consider it cheating, it's cheating. 

## Violations

Violations of this policy result in a zero for the assignment, my perpetual disappointment, and possible additional penalties, including, but not limited to:

- a referral to honor council, 
- failing the class,
- a forensic regrading of all previous assessments,
- forfeiting all extra credit, and
- being excluded from the course curve, drop policy, late policy, and extra credit.




## Things that I thought didn't need to be said, but apparently did need to be said.

Everything must be in your own words, regardless of any open-resource policy. 
Open resources does not mean that you can copy and paste material from outside sources (or from course sources) directly into an assessment.
Assessments are not scavenger hunts. 
Assessments are a means for you to demonstrate your own understanding of the material. 
They are an opportunity to earn points through the demonstration of knowledge.


### It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty...

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to copy outside materials directly into a test or quiz. 

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to copy lecture notes directly into a test or quiz.

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to copy powerpoint slides directly into a test or quiz.

It is still dishonest if you indirectly copy outside materials into a test or quiz.

It is still dishonest if you then edit what you have copied. Frankly that is worse because you tried to hide that you did it.

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to share test questions.  

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to post course materials on any third-party websites. 

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to misrepresent others work as your own.  

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to work together on tests or quizzes. 
(And frankly, it is really obvious in Canvas when you work together. 
I literally wrote a R program that checks for working together on tests. )
