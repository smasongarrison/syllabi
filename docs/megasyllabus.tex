Welcome to all my syllabi! This website is designed to accompany all of Mason Garrison's courses at Wake Forest University.
Over the semesters, I have found that my syllabi keep growing longer and longer as my career has progressed.
I know that no one likes reading 8 page syllabi.
However, I want to make sure that all my students know what my expectations are.
So in that spirit, I've created a website to contain all of my policies in one place.
That way, I can have a neat and tidy syllabi, while still making my expectations clear.

\hypertarget{how-to-use-these-notes}{%
\section*{How to use these notes}\label{how-to-use-these-notes}}


This website is constantly changing. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes.

This document is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, you'll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page. The document will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester; however, students aren't bound to policies added once they've signed their syllabus. Instead, they are bound to the version of this ``book'' that was in place when they signed their syllabus. I have archived versions of this book \href{https://github.com/smasongarrison/syllabi/blob/main/docs/megasyllabus.pdf}{here}.

\hypertarget{attribution}{%
\chapter*{Attribution}\label{attribution}}


This mega syllabus leans on other peoples' materials and ideas. I have done my best to document the origin of the materials and ideas. In particular, I have noted those people whose work has been a major contribution as well as those who have additional contributions. You can see specific changes by examining the \href{https://github.com/smasongarrison/Syllabi/commits/main}{edit history on the git repo}

Welcome! This section includes general syllabus information. The next sections include information specific to your class. (Now, before I forget, any matter not explicitly covered by the syllabus or institution-wide policy is left to my sole discretion as the instructor.)

Remember: This course is for you, not for me.

\hypertarget{materials}{%
\section{Materials}\label{materials}}

If you chose to use alternative materials, such as an older edition of the book, it is your responsibility to ensure that those materials are equivalent.

\hypertarget{required-texts}{%
\subsection{Required Texts}\label{required-texts}}

For all my classes, the textbook is intended to supplement the course.
The lectures don't follow the order of chapters in the text and the text covers some material that won't be covered in the lectures, i.e., not all the information in each chapter is perfectly pertinent to the course requirements.

It is one of many resources you'll consume.
You probably need to consume all of the resources I provide in order to be successful in this class.
If you'd like to make the most of your tuition, I strongly encourage you to consume them all.
The course-specific resources can be found on the specific course page.

\hypertarget{hardware}{%
\subsection{Hardware}\label{hardware}}

Most of my classes require that you have a computer that can run R and stream videos from youtube.

\hypertarget{software}{%
\subsection{Software}\label{software}}

\hypertarget{r-and-rstudio}{%
\subsubsection{R and RStudio}\label{r-and-rstudio}}

\begin{verbatim}
#> NULL
\end{verbatim}

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, and MacOS.

RStudio is a free \emph{integrated development environment} (IDE), a powerful user interface for R.

\hypertarget{git-and-github}{%
\subsubsection{Git and Github}\label{git-and-github}}

Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files -- called a repository -- in a structured way. Think of it like the ``Track Changes'' features from Microsoft Word.

Github is a free IDE and hosting service for Git. As a Wake Forest student, you should be able to access the \href{https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student}{GitHub Student Developer Pack for free}. It includes a free PRO upgrade for your github account.

\hypertarget{part-policies}{%
\part*{Policies}\label{part-policies}}


\hypertarget{policy-overview}{%
\chapter{Policy Overview}\label{policy-overview}}

In this section, I provide specific language for all my course policies. These policies are in addition to those policies and procedures outlined in the university \href{https://bulletin.wfu.edu}{bulletin}. There are slight differences between the \href{https://bulletin.wfu.edu/undergraduate/}{undergraduate college} and the \href{https://bulletin.wfu.edu/graduate/}{graduate school}.

\hypertarget{changes}{%
\section{Changes}\label{changes}}

This syllabus is intended to give the student guidance in what may be covered during the semester and will be followed as closely as possible.
Dates for tests and assignments won't change, barring extraordinary events.
However, I reserve the right to modify, supplement, and make changes as the course needs arise.
I try to avoid changes to the syllabus.
Nevertheless, if changes occur, I will only make changes that are less burdensome and more advantageous to the students.
(If I make a change that increases your burden, please talk to me so that we can find a solution.)

\hypertarget{class-engagement}{%
\chapter{Class Engagement}\label{class-engagement}}

In previous semesters, I have had a deliberately hardline attendance policy.
In the light of the public health crisis, I have done away with the this policy, as it doesn't align with my general philosophy of treating students as junior colleagues. (It also doesn't align with my goal of making it through the pandemic without getting COVID\ldots{} yay, high risk of complications)

Class engagement points are given to encourage your active engagement with the material.
Specific instructions for engagement, can be found on the class website. In general, you will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you engage meaningfully, intentionally, and professionally with the material and your peers. As a reminder, you are still responsible for any assignments and/or announcements made if you miss a class.

\hypertarget{life-happens}{%
\section{Life Happens}\label{life-happens}}

As a reasonable and empathetic human, I recognize that life happens.
There will be times when your outside life conflicts with scheduled class events.
These life events can be any of the obvious things (sports, religious holidays, illness, interviews, etc), but they can also be the less obvious, like spending the entire night looking for your lost pet.
My general approach is to work with you. You just need to let me know \emph{ahead} of time.
These late policies value discussion and communication over deductions and punishment.
It is difficult for me as an instructor to know your situation and reason for lateness (e.g.~are you sick? did you lose wifi? struggling with mental health? or just forgot?).
Without communication, I will assume that students are choosing not to submit work and do not plan on submitting work.
An email will help me better understand your needs and focus on coursework.
I'm more than happy to give extensions and accommodations, so don't be afraid to email me.
You don't need to disclose personal details (your privacy is important to me), so a heads up or request for assistance is enough.

\hypertarget{extensions-absences-incompletes}{%
\section{Extensions, Absences, Incompletes}\label{extensions-absences-incompletes}}

\hypertarget{excused-absences}{%
\subsection{Excused absences}\label{excused-absences}}

Except in the case of \emph{true} emergencies, a possible excused absence should be discussed with me as far in advance as possible and \emph{must} occur beforehand.
You should not assume that an excused absence will automatically be granted -- but you may assume that I am a reasonable, empathetic person.
This discussion should occur via email so that we have a record of it.
If you also discuss your situation verbally, please send a summary of the discussion via email to me.
An unexcused absence will result in a zero for any graded work that should have been performed for or during the missed class.

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsection{Late Work}\label{late-work}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Be sure to pay close attention to deadlines.
\item
  If an assignment is not submitted by the deadline (i.e., is late), the student must email the instructor and provide a new deadline, ask for an alternative, or explain concerns \emph{within 36 hours} of the missed deadline.
\item
  Ideally, you will have communicated with me in advance of the deadline, but on occasion life happens.
\item
  As long as you've communicated \emph{within 36 hours}, I will do my best to work with you to come up with a new deadline or modification, so that you can earn full credit. + Any modifiation or change of deadline must be confirmed in writing. And must be done for each modification.
\item
  This late policy does not apply to exams, tests, or quizzes.
\end{itemize}

If contact is not made \emph{within 36 hours} of the missed deadline, the missing assignment will receive a 0 and can not be made up.

Alternative deadlines will be within one week of the original deadline.

Exceptions to the 1 week policy are at the instructor's discretion. Exceptions are rare.

In general, I am much more sympathetic and accommodating if you communicate in advance.

\hypertarget{submissions}{%
\subsubsection{Submissions}\label{submissions}}

It is your responsibility to ensure that the instructor has received the assignment by the established due date and to ensure that the assignment submitted is the complete and correct version.

Unless otherwise explicitly specified, all work must be submitted through Canvas.

Unless you have communicated with me in advance, there will be no make-up quizzes or tests.

\hypertarget{incomplete-grades}{%
\subsection{Incomplete Grades}\label{incomplete-grades}}

I did not make this policy.

Although the language surrounding incompletes differs slightly across the bulletins ( \href{https://bulletin.wfu.edu/undergraduate/procedures/exams-grading/\#:~:text=Incomplete\%20Grade}{undergraduate}; \href{https://bulletin.wfu.edu/graduate/procedures/grading/\#:~:text=Grade\%20of\%20I}{graduate}), and office of \href{https://advising.wfu.edu/academic-challenges/incompletes/}{academic advising}, the intent is consistent.
Incompletes can only be granted IF a student fails to complete the work of a course because of something outside of the student's control, such as an illness, emergency, or extenuating circumstances. The window for completing the work is narrow, typically 30 days into the next semester. If the work isn't completed after that point, the grade is automatically changed to an F.

\hypertarget{accommodations-policy}{%
\chapter{Accommodations Policy}\label{accommodations-policy}}

If you are (or become) disabled (in any capacity, permanently, or temporarily), and need accommodations in class, reading, or any other work in this course, please contact me to discuss your specific needs as soon as possible.
Under the \href{https://beta.ada.gov/}{Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADA_Amendments_Act_of_2008}{ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008}, you are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations for disabilities.
I will do everything in my capacity as your professor to ensure that you receive those accommodations.

Students who need reasonable accommodations for disabilities also should contact the Learning Assistance Center \& Disability Services (118 Reynolda Hall, 336-758-5929, \href{https://lac.wfu.edu/}{lac.wfu.edu}). You can request accommodations through the student portal here: \url{https://olympic.accessiblelearning.com/WFU/}. These accommodations are not retroactive. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to use those accommodations.

Do not feel guilty about using them.
You rightfully deserve them, in the legal, moral, and ethical sense.
These accommodations are there so that you can be your best possible self.

\hypertarget{self-advocacy}{%
\section{Self-Advocacy}\label{self-advocacy}}

At Wake Forest and at many other places, the expectation is that you will self-advocate for yourselves and know exactly what you need. Is that a good expectation? Is that a good model? Is that equitable? I have thoughts\ldots{} regardless, that is the current state of the world. Accordingly, you will have to advocate for what you need. If this process seems daunting, please talk to me! Regardless, I am happy to talk with you about this process and to share my own experiences.

\begin{quote}
Every time we write that self-advocacy is key to disabled students'
success, we need to include an asterisk and note, "BUT IT SHOULDN'T
BE"\\
~\\
Disabled students deserve success regardless of how well they can
navigate the system and cajole/plead/argue with profs for access.

As a student, you may not know what accommodations work best for you. Or you may find that your current accommodations don't work like they used to.

As you journey thru your career, you may find that you need different kinds of accommodations. Or at least that has been my experience\ldots{} There are numerous resources for ideas.
My personal favorite is \href{https://askjan.org/}{JAN}. Technically, JAN (Job Accommodation Network) is focused on employment and jobs.
However, I still have found this to be a wonderful resource for ideas.

\chapter{Classroom Climate}\label{classroom-climate}}

I aim to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including but not limited to race, ethnicity, sex, gender, gender-identity, class, sexual orientation, religion, ability, political affiliation). To help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you.
\item
  I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
\item
  If you reached here in the syllabus, e-mail me a picture of a cat. If you do it before the end of the first week, you get a small bonus. (And even if its after the first week, feel free to still send me a cat picture.)

The Psychology Department values, respects, and celebrates the experiences, beliefs, and practices stemming from varied cultures and circumstances ( emphasizing, but not limited to, those from marginalized groups, including those historically underrepresented). We center our department around our deep commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and access. That deep commitment plays out through coursework, programming by majors, service, outreach, and research.

\hypertarget{academic-honesty-policy}{%
\chapter{Academic Honesty Policy}\label{academic-honesty-policy}}

In this course, you will be held to the standards of the Wake Forest Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you signed your application for admission to the institution.
If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the \href{https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu/}{Honor System Handbook}.
That handbook outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.

All submitted work must be your own. It is your responsibility to avoid even the appearance of cheating.

Unless I have explicitly stated otherwise, every assessment is closed to outside resources (including, but not limited to books, notes, phones, people, Chegg, the internet).
Ignorance of the honor code and assignment instructions is not an acceptable explanation and/or defense.

\hypertarget{common-sense}{%
\section{Common Sense}\label{common-sense}}

To be clear, even if something is NOT explicitly forbidden in this document, that does not mean it is allowed. Please use your common sense here. If a reasonable person would consider it cheating, it's cheating.

\hypertarget{violations}{%
\section{Violations}\label{violations}}

Violations of this policy result in a zero for the assignment, my perpetual disappointment, and possible additional penalties, including, but not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a referral to honor council,
\item
  failing the class,
\item
  a forensic regrading of all previous assessments,
\item
  forfeiting all extra credit, and
\item
  being excluded from the course curve, drop policy, late policy, and extra credit.
\end{itemize}

\section{Things that I thought didn't need to be said, but apparently did need to be said.}\label{things-that-i-thought-didnt-need-to-be-said-but-apparently-did-need-to-be-said.}}

Everything must be in your own words, regardless of any open-resource policy.
Open resources does not mean that you can copy and paste material from outside sources (or from course sources) directly into an assessment.
Assessments are not scavenger hunts.
Assessments are a means for you to demonstrate your own understanding of the material.
They are an opportunity to earn points through the demonstration of knowledge.

\hypertarget{it-is-always-academic-dishonesty}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty\ldots{}}{It is ALWAYS academic dishonesty\ldots{}}}\label{it-is-always-academic-dishonesty}}

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to copy outside materials directly into a test or quiz.

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to copy lecture notes directly into a test or quiz.

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to copy powerpoint slides directly into a test or quiz.

It is still dishonest if you indirectly copy outside materials into a test or quiz.

It is still dishonest if you then edit what you have copied. Frankly that is worse because you tried to hide that you did it.

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to share test questions.

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to post course materials on any third-party websites.

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to misrepresent others work as your own.

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to work together on tests or quizzes.
(And frankly, it is really obvious in Canvas when you work together.
I literally wrote a R program that checks for working together on tests. )

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\chapter{Communication}\label{communication}}

Be mindful that there is a person on the other end of your request -- me. I'm a person. So please be intentional with your emails and recognize that my time in finite. It is in everyone's best interest that I spend my time engaging with students in meaningful ways, not pointing you to material you can find on your own. Be sure to check the syllabus, course website, course content, and classmates before emailing me. This practice is important training for life after college -- when you have a question, the first thing you do should not be to email your boss. I do not want to discourage you from engaging with me. I love teaching because I love interacting with students. However, I do not want to engage with you in ways that nurture your inability to critically think and prevents me from engaging with other students.

If you are ever uncertain about the purpose of an assignment, the learning objectives of an activity, or how an assessment will be graded, please reach out. My goal is to be organized, thoughtful, and transparent. All my assignments were thoughtfully chosen. There is no busy work or unnecessary required course material. If I have done a poor job explaining the motivation for any aspect of my course, please let me know so I can be more clear.

\hypertarget{minimums}{%
\section{Minimums}\label{minimums}}

You are expected to read every LMS announcement, message, and email; as well as view the media embedded within those communications. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. At minimum, you should be checking your communications within 24 hours. Ignorance of a class communication is not grounds for an excused absence or extension.

\hypertarget{self-advocacy-1}{%
\subsection{Self Advocacy}\label{self-advocacy-1}}

If you are struggling in this class, please talk to me. Do not assume that I know what is going on in your life. Talk to me and tell me what you need.

\hypertarget{grading-questions}{%
\subsection{Grading Questions}\label{grading-questions}}

Please send any questions about grades in writing via email within \emph{two} weeks after the assignment is returned. If I erred in scoring or in calculating the grade, I will happily update the record. Otherwise, I will be most receptive toward questions framed in terms of your learning (rather than simply your performance), as research has shown that focusing overly on extrinsic rewards (like grades) is likely to lead to all sorts of outcomes that I don't wish for you (lower interest in the course material, lower learning, lower enjoyment).

\hypertarget{instructor-availability}{%
\section{Instructor Availability}\label{instructor-availability}}

I am readily accessible during business hours (9:00AM-5:30PM; Monday-Friday) via \href{garrissm@wfu.edu}{email}/ LMS/ git/ zoom/ carrier pigeon/\href{https://calendly.com/smasongarrison/}{calendly}. Outside those hours, I do not typically respond to messages, in order to devote time to my family, rest, and living my life. Messages received during these times will receive attention once I am back online. Otherwise you can expect to receive a response to your message within 12 to 24 hours, often much sooner. If you do not hear back after 36 hours, please follow-up with me.

I have given out my cell-phone number, in the case of \emph{true} emergencies. Please be mindful that poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency for me.

All or some in-person and synchronous classes may be recorded. Student images and voices may be captured in these recordings. I will do my best to protect that information from being shared outside the confines of the class. Recordings with students in them will be available for viewing only by students enrolled in the class via Canvas or an alternative platform. The recordings are intended to improve access course content. No other recording, including by students, is permitted without explicit permission. (Recordings for notetaking or accommodations are typically permitted. Just chat with me about it.)

\hypertarget{recording-tails-in-our-synchronous-classes.}{%
\subsection{Recording Tails in our Synchronous Classes.}\label{recording-tails-in-our-synchronous-classes.}}

\hypertarget{access-to-recordings.}{%
\subsection{Access to Recordings.}\label{access-to-recordings.}}

Students may access the class recordings made available to them solely for the purpose of participating in the course. The recordings may not be used by any person other than a student enrolled in the course or for any purpose other than to participate in the course. Students are prohibited from downloading or distributing any portion of the recordings for any purpose. Students should understand that technical problems or human error may prevent successful recording.

Here's the deal. I'm \emph{probably} at increased risk of complications. In this class, mask compliance is essential for us (and me) making it through the semester. At present, I am in the position where I have to put my health in your hands. I have many thoughts as to why, how, and who has led to me being in this present position. I don't fault students. However, I need you to understand that the stakes are high.

Regardless of any changes to university policy or mask mandates, we will be masked for the entire semester. You will put your mask on \emph{before} you enter my class. Your mask will cover your nose and mouth. I will stop class if I see your nose. If your struggle with this, I am very happy to show you how to properly secure your mask. Truly. I would love to show you how, so that we can all be a little safer. If you feel sick or are exposed, please don't come to class. I will happily meet with you (remotely) to fill you in.

We share responsibility for the health and safety of each other in a learning space. Maintaining a consistent six feet of distance; wearing face coverings that cover our mouths and noses; limiting our gathering sizes; and isolating or quarantining when ill or exposed to someone with the virus are Wake Forest University directives and policies we all must follow. Students are encouraged to visit \href{https://ourwayforward.wfu.edu/}{Our Way Forward} to stay informed about the latest guidance and review the \href{https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/public-health-emergency-addendum/}{Public Health Emergency Addendum to the Student Code of Conduct}.

Specifically, in this room, we will mitigate the risks of virus transfer and take care of our community by abiding by the following safety directives:
- maintain six feet of distance at all times when feasible.
- wear a face covering for the entirety of class indoors and out (unless there is exemption via an approved safety plan for specific coursework). This face covering should cover your mouth and your nose, and adhere to our \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tqo-by1sjmc-kWUTwAqeNdaHq8OBsU9B/view}{University face covering policy} (no face shields without masks; no neck gaiters; no bandanas; and no masks, including N95, with a one-way valve).
- stay out of class when sick or after being exposed to someone who is sick.

In this class, any student who does not follow these requirements will be asked once to follow the safety directives.

I will offer you a mask or ask you to find one.

If you do not comply, I will ask you to leave the class for that day.

\href{https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?WakeForestUniv\&layout_id=40}{I will also refer the matter to the COVID-19 compliance reporting system}. Possible disciplinary actions may follow as described in the Wake Forest University Student Conduct Code Public Health Emergency Addendum.

Methods in Psychological Research introduces statistics and research design for students minoring in psychology. Prereq: P---PSY 151 (D, QR)

This course is designed to help students develop the conceptual background and practical skills necessary to evaluate the statistics encountered in their coursework and in everyday life. It emphasizes selection, application, and interpretation. Topics to be covered include statistical inference, probability distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing, and correlation. The goal will be to go beyond rote memorization of abstract formulas and for students to develop an appreciation for the critical role that statistics plays in psychological science.

This course provides an overview of the development and nature of psychological tests with applications to school counseling, business, and clinical practice. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an understanding of the principles of measurement as applied to group standardized measures of achievement, special aptitude, intelligence, personality, interests and distress for use in counseling. Format will consist primarily of lectures along with group participation activities.

\hypertarget{course-objectives}{%

\item
  To acquaint you with the fundamental vocabulary and logic of psychological measurement and behavioral assessment.
\item
  To develop your capacity for critical judgment of the adequacy of measures purported to assess behavior in the role of theory development.
\item
  To acquaint you with some of the relevant literature in personality assessment, psychometric theory and practice, and methods of observing and measuring behavior.
\item
  To instill in you an appreciation of and an interest in the principles and methods of psychometric theory in general and behavior assessment in particular.
\item
  This course is not designed to make you into an accomplished psychometrist (one who gives tests) nor is it designed to make you a skilled psychometrician (one who constructs tests), nor will it give you ``hands on'' experience with psychometric computer programs. Rather it is aimed to allow you to understand the fundamental theoretical issues concerning both the psychometrist and the psychometrician.
\item
  Because modern psychometrics and statistics may be done using open source software such as R, examples will be presented in R.

The text \citep{anastasi1997} is intended to supplement the lectures.

Typically, an A- is defined as 90\% of the highest point total in the class, B- as 80\% of that total, C- as 70 and D- as 60\%.
I may shift these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point distribution.
By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher grades than if no re-scaling were done.
This curve can only help your grade.

Data Science for Psychologists (DSP) introduces on the principles of data science, including data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and communication. In this class, we link those principles to psychological methods and open science practices by emphasizing exploratory analyses and description, rather than confirmatory analyses and prediction. We'll work our way thru Wickham and Grolemund's R for Data Science text (\url{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/}) and develop expertise in tidyverse (\url{https://www.tidyverse.org/}). This class emphasizes replication and reproducibility. DSP is a practical skilled-based class and should be useful to students aiming for academia as well as those interested in industry. Applications of these methods can be applied to a full range of psychological areas, including perception (e.g, eye-tracking data), neuroscience (e.g., visualizing neural networks), and individual differences (e.g., valence analysis).

\hypertarget{portfolio}{%

The major semester projects (described on the data science website) is a set of EDA Projects, which you will summarize in an EDA Portfolio to be handed in on the last day of class.

\hypertarget{engagement}{%
\subsection*{Engagement}\label{engagement}}


This experiential course requires active engagement. There will be few lectures and we will not be building toward an exam. Instead, we will work together to build our facilities for thinking critically about data. You should come to every class having read all of the required reading, watched the required videos, browsed the suggested resources, and so forth. You should enter the classroom prepared to discuss these materials with colleagues and complete both individual and group in-class assignments.

\hypertarget{grading-policy-3}{%
\section*{Grading Policy}\label{grading-policy-3}}


In this course, you will determine the grade you receive by fulfilling a contract you will submit for my approval on 01/21.

Your written contract will detail:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The requirements you will meet in order to receive the grade for which you've contracted,
\item
  the penalties you will incur for not meeting those requirements,
\item
  a calendar you will follow for meeting the requirements you have outlined.
\end{itemize}

Many aspects of this calendar will be determined by windows outlined on the course schedule, but your contract will take ownership of these deadlines while committing to specific due dates for the course's more flexible assignments.

\hypertarget{contract-details}{%
\section*{Contract Details}\label{contract-details}}


To fulfill any grade contract a student must do the following, which should nonetheless be specified in the contract submitted for approval. When writing self-assessments students must describe how they have met these requirements in addition to the grade-specific requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Come to class prepared to discuss any assigned readings, videos, or other media. Participate actively in class activities and discussions, making observations and asking questions that help the class think together.
\item
  Meet with me in person---during office hours or another scheduled time---at least once around midterm---roughly between weeks 5-8 to ensure you are on-track to meet your contract requirements, discuss any questions or concerns you have about the course or your progress, and decide on any necessary contract amendments.
\item
  Revise contractual assignments as necessary until both you and I consider them ``Satisfactory.''
\item
  Complete a final self-assessment demonstrating that your work has met the agreed requirements, submitting it to me by 5pm on the last day of class.
\end{itemize}

The professor reserves the right to award a grade of D or F to anyone who fails to meet a contractual obligation in a systematic way. A ``D'' grade denotes some minimal fulfilling of the contract. An ``F'' is absence of enough satisfactory work, as contracted, to warrant passing of the course. Both a ``D'' and ``F'' denote a breakdown of the contractual relationship implied by signing any of the contracts described above.

\hypertarget{what-about-exceptional-or-mediocre-work}{%
\section*{What About Exceptional (or Mediocre) Work?}\label{what-about-exceptional-or-mediocre-work}}


I also reserve the right to reward exceptional work throughout the semester using the full range of Wake Forest's grading scale. If you contract for a ``B,'' for instance, and submit particularly strong pieces to fulfill that contract, I may elect to raise your contracted grade to a ``B+.''

Likewise, if you consistently submit mediocre work in fulfillment of your contract, I reserve the right to adjust your grade one half-step down (e.g.~from ``A'' to ``A-``) or even, in extreme cases, a full step.

\hypertarget{contract-adjustments}{%
\section*{Contract Adjustments}\label{contract-adjustments}}


Periodically during the semester I will ask you to evaluate your work thus far and compare it against what you agreed in your grade contract. In these moments you can also take the opportunity to request an adjustment to your contract in either direction. If you find that you will be unable to meet the obligations of your contract, you may request to move to the next lowest grade and its requirements. Contrariwise, if you find that you've been performing above the obligations of your contract, you may request to fulfill the requirements for the next higher grade. Important Note: In order to effectively evaluate your own progress, you must keep track of your work, including days missed, and so forth.

\hypertarget{contract-grades}{%

\hypertarget{a-contract}{%
\subsection*{``A'' Contract}\label{a-contract}}

\item
  Produce at least 10 ``Satisfactory'' portfolio pieces over the course of the semester.

  Complete two ``Satisfactory'' Unessays on a schedule you will specify in your contract and present the strongest as an asynchronous presentation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{b-contract}{%

\hypertarget{why-is-your-speaking-style-so-weird}{%
\subsubsection{Why is your speaking style so weird?}\label{why-is-your-speaking-style-so-weird}}

I get this comment frequently enough in course evaluations (but never face-to-face\ldots). Most students don't have a problem with it, and it seems that most people recognize that it is outside my control. My speaking style can become a bit fragmented -- students tend to describe it as tangential, scattered, incomprehensible (also some much less kind things\ldots{} that are often really ableist). But that's not actually, what's happening\ldots{} what's happening is a mixture of cluttering and some other less well-known speech dysfluencies. Practically, this means I will on occasion skip the last syllable in a word or the last word of a sentence or repeat a phrase.

I recognize that it can be frustrating. I hear you. I really do. I cannot help it. And trust me, I am frustrated by it as well.

Please, understand that there's not much more I can do at this point. And I have done a lot.

What you are experiencing is the result of years of speech therapy and is a massive improvement. If you \emph{genuinely} struggle to understand me, please TALK to me about it. I can connect you with resources, including my scripts, previous recordings of lectures. If those don't help, we can work in the LAC to figure out an accommodation that works for both of us. PLEASE do not wait until after the course is over and complain after the fact. That is not helpful to anyone.

The time you spend on a class can vary. No two instructors will format their classes exactly the same. Nevertheless, under the standard {[}``Carnegie Unit''{]} (\url{https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/faqs/carnegie-unit/}), each credit hour corresponds to a \emph{minimum} of 3 hours of student engagement per week for a traditional 15-week course. This time may be spent on discussions, readings, and lectures, study, and research, and assignments. See the WFU registrar for \href{https://registrar.wfu.edu/semester-credit-hour/}{more details} if you'd like

If you find yourself spending a lot more or a lot less than 9 hours per week on this class, please let me know. That probably means that either you're doing too much or too little.

\chapter{How to do well in my classes}\label{how-to-do-well-in-my-classes}}

To do well in the course, you should read the assigned material before class and re-read previously assigned material as the course progresses.
By reading the text before class, you will be better prepared to ask questions and integrate the content of lectures with what was presented in the text.
For synchronous classes, be sure to attend all lectures and arrive on time.
For asynchronous classes be sure to watch all the video lectures and don't leave them until the last minute. Each topic builds directly on the previous one.
Thus, if you miss one lecture or zip through a video, you run the risk of being completely lost in the next lecture.
