# Public Health in the Age of COVID-19



Here's the deal. I'm *definitely* at increased risk of developing complications from a COVID-19 infection. My disability is FINALLY on the CDC list of at risk conditions^[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html#anchor_1618433687270]. To mitigate those risks, I require masks in my classroom. This disability accommodation has been authorized and approved by the university, as a reasonable accommodation. In this class, mask compliance is essential for us (and me) making it through the semester. At present, I am in the position where I have to put my health in your hands. I have many thoughts as to why, how, and who has led to me being in this present position. I don't fault students. However, I need you to understand that the stakes are high. 

Regardless of any changes to university policy or mask mandates, we will be masked for the entire semester. You will put your mask on *before* you enter my class. Your mask will cover your nose and mouth. I will stop class if I see your nose. 
If you feel sick or are exposed, please don't come to class. I will happily meet with you (remotely) to fill you in. 
- If you struggle with securing your mask, I am very happy to show you how to properly secure your mask^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzTAZDsNBe0]. 
- If your struggle with masks is due to your own disability, I am happy to connect you with student disability services. We can go through the interactive process with CLASS and your health care provider. Through that interactive process we can determine if your disability can be accommodated without fundamentally altering the course. These alternative accommodations could include providing you with differ styles of masks, or additional training on how to properly secure your mask.

However, if you refuse to wear a mask, you need to leave. If you refuse to leave, I will leave. And if I leave, there is no class.

## Masks and Equity

Although university policy states that we can request masks instead of requiring them (barring specific circumstances), we can not provide an equitable and just atmosphere for learning if we are not protecting one another from COVID by masking. Refusing to mask indoors is a manifestation of ableism and racism, an exercise of individual privilege that tells the most vulnerable that their health does not matter. To practice community care, we will mask to protect those of us with compromised immune systems, those of us with family members unable to get vaccinated, those of us who do not want to transmit the virus to others, and those of us who want to avoid re/infection.

## WFU-Required Statement

As once required by Wake Forest University, I have included the following information related to public health. It is reproduced verbatim. Dead links and all. 

> We share responsibility for the health and safety of each other in a learning space. Maintaining a consistent six feet of distance; wearing face coverings that cover our mouths and noses; limiting our gathering sizes; and isolating or quarantining when ill or exposed to someone with the virus are Wake Forest University directives and policies we all must follow. Students are encouraged to visit [Our Way Forward](https://ourwayforward.wfu.edu/) to stay informed about the latest guidance and review the [Public Health Emergency Addendum to the Student Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/public-health-emergency-addendum/).  
>
> Specifically, in this room, we will mitigate the risks of virus transfer and take care of our community by abiding by the following safety directives: 
>
> - maintain six feet of distance at all times when feasible. 
>
> - wear a face covering for the entirety of class indoors and out (unless there is exemption via an approved safety plan for specific coursework). This face covering should cover your mouth and your nose, and adhere to our [University face covering policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tqo-by1sjmc-kWUTwAqeNdaHq8OBsU9B/view) (no face shields without masks; no neck gaiters; no bandanas; and no masks, including N95, with a one-way valve). 
>
> - stay out of class when sick or after being exposed to someone who is sick.
>
> In this class, any student who does not follow these requirements will be asked once to follow the safety directives. 
>
> I will offer you a mask or ask you to find one. 
> 
> If you do not comply, I will ask you to leave the class for that day. 
>
> [I will also refer the matter to the COVID-19 compliance reporting system](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?WakeForestUniv&layout_id=40). Possible disciplinary actions may follow as described in the Wake Forest University Student Conduct Code Public Health Emergency Addendum.
