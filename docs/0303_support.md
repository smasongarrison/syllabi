### Accurately Calculating Grades in Canvas

**Students: Make sure you are seeing the right grades in Canvas!**

* You're probably familiar with [checking your grades for a current course in Canvas](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-my-grades-in-a-current-course/ta-p/493), but did you know that you might not be seeing an accurate calculation of your final grade when you check your grades at the end of the semester?

* In order to get an accurate view of your final grade towards the end of the semester, make sure to uncheck the Calculate based only on graded assignments checkbox:

#### WFU Honor Code Definitions

**These definitions are reproduced from the [WFU Honor Code](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/procedures-of-the-honor-and-ethics-council/)**


Cheating, plagiarism, stealing, deception, academic misconduct, and contempt are considered violations of the Honor Code. These terms should be construed to have their ordinary, non-legal meaning.

1. The term “cheating” includes:
  + (a) providing or receiving unauthorized assistance in academic endeavors (e.g., quizzes, tests, examinations, reports, term papers);

  + (b) use of sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers,     preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments; or

  + (c) the use, without permission, of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of the University faculty or staff.

2. “Plagiarism” is a type of cheating. It includes:
  + (a) the use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of the published or unpublished work of another person without complete acknowledgment of the source;

  + (b) the unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another agency or person providing term papers or other academic materials;

  + (c) the non-attributed use of any portion of a computer algorithm or data file; or

  + (d) the use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of online material without complete acknowledgment of the source.

|      When faced with conflicting definitions of plagiarism during a case, the Honor and Ethics Council will adopt the definition established for use in the department/course by the department or professor involved in the case.

3. The term “stealing” includes:
  + (a) the unauthorized taking, misappropriation, or possession of any property belonging to, owned by, or maintained by the University, an organization, or another individual, or

  + (b) the possession, retention, or disposal of stolen property.

4. The term “deception” includes any false or deceiving representation. In the academic context, such representations include:
  + (a) any attempt to avoid meeting the stated course requirements, such as making false statements to avoid taking examinations at the scheduled times or to avoid turning in assignments at the scheduled times;

  + (b) listing sources in a bibliography not directly used in the academic exercise; or

  + (c) submitting falsified, invented, or fictitious data or evidence, or concealing or distorting the true nature, origin, or function of data or evidence.

|      In the social context, deceptive representations include:

  + (a) making a false statement to a University official, including Residence Advisors, or

  + (b) presenting a false identification.

5. The term “academic misconduct” may be used as a generic designation for all honor code violations in the academic context. As a specific charge it includes:
  + (a) the violation of University policies by tampering with grades

  + (b) taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of an unadministered academic exercise;

  + (c) any attempt to gain access or to aid another in gaining access to any computer account other than one’s own without proper authorization; or

  + (d) any attempt to gain access or to aid another in gaining access, without proper authorization, to department offices, faculty offices, laboratories, or any other place where unadministered assignments are kept.

6. The term “contempt” includes:
  + (a) instances of perjury (giving false testimony), or

  + (b) acts which otherwise obstruct the conduct process.

*Note: Cheating, stealing, making false or deceiving statements, plagiarism, vandalism, and harassment are just as wrong when done in the context of computing as they are in all other aspects of University conduct.*
