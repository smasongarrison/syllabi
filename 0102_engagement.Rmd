# Class Engagement, Presence, and Participation.

In previous semesters, I have had a deliberately hardline attendance policy. 
In the light of the public health crisis, I have done away with the this policy, as it doesn't align with my general philosophy of treating students as junior colleagues. 

Class engagement points are given to encourage your active engagement with the material. 
Specific instructions for engagement, can be found on the class website In general, you will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you engage meaningfully, intentionally, and professionally with the material and your peers. As a reminder, you are still responsible for any assignments and/or announcements made if you miss a class.


## Life Happens (Extensions and Absences)

As a reasonable and empathetic human, I recognize that life happens. 
There will be times when your outside life conflicts with scheduled class events. 
These life events can be any of the obvious things (sports, religious holidays, illness, interviews, etc), but they can also be the less obvious, like spending the entire night looking for your lost pet. 
My general approach is to work with you. You just need to let me know *ahead* of time. 
These late policies value discussion and communication over deductions and punishment. 
It is difficult for me as an instructor to know your situation and reason for lateness (e.g. are you sick? did you lose wifi? struggling with mental health? or just forgot?). 
Without communication, I will assume that students are choosing not to submit work and do not plan on submitting work. 
An email will help me better understand your needs and focus on coursework. 
I'm more than happy to give extensions and accommodations, so don't be afraid to email me. 
You don't need to disclose personal details (your privacy is important to me), so a heads up or request for assistance is enough.


### Excused absences

Except in the case of *true* emergencies, a possible excused absence should be discussed with me as far in advance as possible and *must* occur beforehand. 
You should not assume that an excused absence will automatically be granted -- but you may assume that I am a reasonable, empathetic person. 
This discussion should occur via email so that we have a record of it.
If you also discuss your situation verbally, please send a summary of the discussion via email to me. 
An unexcused absence will result in a zero for any graded work that should have been performed for or during the missed class. 


### Late Work

Be sure to pay close attention to deadlines. 
If an assignment is not submitted by the deadline (i.e., is late), the student must email the instructor and provide a new deadline, ask for an alternative, or explain concerns *within `r gracewindow`* of the missed deadline. 
Ideally, you will have communicated with me in advance of the deadline, but on occasion life happens. 
As long as you've communicated *within `r gracewindow`*, I will do my best to work with you to come up with a new deadline or modification, so that you can earn full credit. 
This late policy does not apply to exams, tests, or quizzes.

If contact is not made *within `r gracewindow`* of the missed deadline, the missing assignment will receive a 0. 
Alternative deadlines will be within one week of the original deadline. 
Exceptions to the 1 week policy are at the instructor's discretion. In general, I will be much more sympathetic and accommodating if you communicate in advance. 

It is your responsibility to ensure that the instructor has received the assignment by the established due date and to ensure that the assignment submitted is the complete and correct version. 
Unless otherwise specified, all work must be submitted through Canvas.

Unless you have communicated with me in advance, there will be no make-up quizzes or tests.
